It includes only public school districts, and it contains a column denoting whether that year contained any null values -- meaning categories of employees where no numeric value was provided. This appears to represent legitimate zero values for many rows, but it also appears to indicate missing data in some cases. The reason we need this \"asterisk\" is that in cases where data is missing, it would falsely be identified later on as a cut or increase.\n",
